The file /my-react-native-web-app/my-react-native-web-app/assets/case5.png is intended to be an image file. Since I cannot generate image files directly, please ensure that you have the appropriate image file saved as case5.png in the specified directory. If you need a placeholder or a specific image, you can create or download an image and save it as case5.png in the assets folder.
