The file /my-react-native-web-app/my-react-native-web-app/assets/case3.png is intended to be an image file. Since I cannot generate image files directly, please ensure that you have the appropriate image for case 3 and place it in the specified directory. If you need a placeholder or a specific image, you can create or download an image and save it as case3.png in the assets folder.
